## The Challenge

Utilizing Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks, will perform data analysis of a fictional e-commerce company. Common business questions will be explored, such as determining who are the top spending customers, what products are most purchased, the company profits, etc. The challenge incorporates data exploration, transformation, analysis, cleaning, processing, and extraction from a large data set that would be common in a data science job position.

## Starter Code

The starter code for this challenge consists of two files.  

1. A comma-separated values (CSV) file that provides all the data for a fictional e-commerce company.
2. A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file that prompts for the expected code and initially displays the expected output from each cell.

When the correct code is inserted into each cell the output should match the original file. Additionally there is one open ended self-exploration prompt.

## Challenge Checklist

### Part 1: Explore the Data

- [x] View column names (as a list object)
- [x] Display basic statistics
- [x] Become familiar with the data: open-ended
- [x] List the three highest categories
- [x] List the highest subcategory of the highest category
- [x] List the five clients with most purchases (by ID)
- [x] Store those five clients' IDs in a list
- [x] Find the total items purchased by the top client

### Part 2: Transform the Data

- [x] Create and calculate a subtotal column
- [x] Create and calculate a shipping price column
- [x] Create and calculate a total price column
- [x] Create and calculate a manufacturing cost column
- [x] Create and calculate a profit column

### Part 3: Confirm the Work

- [x] Match three calculations with fictional emailed totals

### Part 4: Summarize and Analyze

- [x] Calculate how much top five clients spent
- [x] Create summary dataframe of totals for top five clients sorted by total profit
- [x] Format the data to presentation quality
- [x] Sort data by highest total profit (again?)

## Running the Program

The program folder contains one Jupyter notebook which can be run cell by cell from and results displayed in Jupyter, Jupyter Lab, or VS code with Jupyter extensions.

```
module_4_challenge.ipynb
```

The outputs for all cells in the notebook have been cleared. The notebook cells should be run from top to bottom. All outputs after running should match the original starter code file, with the addition of outputs for the open ended data exploration step.
