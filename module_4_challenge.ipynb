    "While client 33615 ordered items most frequently, we find that the next four clients by number of orders spent a lot more money.  In fact, client 24741 spent more than six times the next closest client, 38378, and nearly 10 times that of client 33615.  We also made an 44% profit margin on sales to client 24741, better than the 25–32% margin of the other top clients.  Finally, I would suggest we find a new shipper or negotiate a better rate.  When our clients are spending multi-millions in shipping costs alone, we are doing them a disservice."
